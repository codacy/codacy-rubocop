Checks that spec file paths are consistent and well-formed.

By default, this checks that spec file paths are consistent with the
test subject and and enforces that it reflects the described
class/module and its optionally called out method.

With the configuration option `IgnoreMethods` the called out method will
be ignored when determining the enforced path.

With the configuration option `CustomTransform` modules or classes can
be specified that should not as usual be transformed from CamelCase to
snake_case (e.g. 'RuboCop' => 'rubocop' ).

With the configuration option `SpecSuffixOnly` test files will only
be checked to ensure they end in '_spec.rb'. This option disables
checking for consistency in the test subject or test methods.
