Checks for use of the helper methods which reference
instance variables.

Relying on instance variables makes it difficult to re-use helper
methods.

If it seems awkward to explicitly pass in each dependent
variable, consider moving the behavior elsewhere, for
example to a model, decorator or presenter.

Provided that a class inherits `ActionView::Helpers::FormBuilder`,
an offense will not be registered.

# Examples

```ruby
# bad
def welcome_message
  "Hello #{@user.name}"
end

# good
def welcome_message(user)
  "Hello #{user.name}"
end

# good
class MyFormBuilder < ActionView::Helpers::FormBuilder
  @template.do_something
end
```
