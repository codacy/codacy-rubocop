Checks the indentation of the here document bodies. The bodies
are indented one step.

Note: When ``Layout/LineLength``'s `AllowHeredoc` is false (not default),
      this cop does not add any offenses for long here documents to
      avoid ``Layout/LineLength``'s offenses.

# Examples

```ruby
# bad
<<-RUBY
something
RUBY

# good
<<~RUBY
  something
RUBY
```
