Checks for the use of `Kernel#open` and `URI.open` with dynamic
data.

`Kernel#open` and `URI.open` enable not only file access but also process
invocation by prefixing a pipe symbol (e.g., `open("| ls")`).
So, it may lead to a serious security risk by using variable input to
the argument of `Kernel#open` and `URI.open`. It would be better to use
`File.open`, `IO.popen` or `URI.parse#open` explicitly.

NOTE: `open` and `URI.open` with literal strings are not flagged by this
cop.

# Examples

```ruby
# bad
open(something)
open("| #{something}")
URI.open(something)

# good
File.open(something)
IO.popen(something)
URI.parse(something).open

# good (literal strings)
open("foo.text")
open("| foo")
URI.open("http://example.com")
```
