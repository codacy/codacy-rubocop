Bare access modifiers (those not applying to specific methods) should be
indented as deep as method definitions, or as deep as the `class`/`module`
keyword, depending on configuration.

# Examples

```ruby
# bad
class Plumbus
private
  def smooth; end
end

# good
class Plumbus
  private
  def smooth; end
end# bad
class Plumbus
  private
  def smooth; end
end

# good
class Plumbus
private
  def smooth; end
end
```
