Checks the indentation of the right hand side operand in binary operations that
span more than one line.

The `aligned` style checks that operators are aligned if they are part of an `if` or `while`
condition, an explicit `return` statement, etc. In other contexts, the second operand should
be indented regardless of enforced style.

In both styles, operators should be aligned when an assignment begins on the next line.

# Examples

```ruby
# bad
if a +
    b
  something &&
  something_else
end

# good
if a +
   b
  something &&
    something_else
end# bad
if a +
   b
  something &&
  something_else
end

# good
if a +
    b
  something &&
    something_else
end
```
