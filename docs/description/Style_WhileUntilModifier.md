Checks for while and until statements that would fit on one line
if written as a modifier while/until. The maximum line length is
configured in the `Layout/LineLength` cop.

# Examples

```ruby
# bad
while x < 10
  x += 1
end

# good
x += 1 while x < 10

# bad
until x > 10
  x += 1
end

# good
x += 1 until x > 10

# bad
x += 100 while x < 500 # a long comment that makes code too long if it were a single line

# good
while x < 500 # a long comment that makes code too long if it were a single line
  x += 100
end
```
