Checks that blocks are used for interpolated strings passed to
`Rails.logger.debug`.

By default, Rails production environments use the `:info` log level.
At the `:info` log level, `Rails.logger.debug` statements do not result
in log output. However, Ruby must eagerly evaluate interpolated string
arguments passed as method arguments. Passing a block to
`Rails.logger.debug` prevents costly evaluation of interpolated strings
when no output would be produced anyway.

# Examples

```ruby
#bad
Rails.logger.debug "The time is #{Time.zone.now}."

#good
Rails.logger.debug { "The time is #{Time.zone.now}." }
```
